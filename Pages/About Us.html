            <p class="font1">After more than 20 years in the restaurant industry, it was time to move on. Time to move
              forward. Time
              to light a fire.
              Jeremy is excited to present his passion for craft barbecue to the world. Following the typical "quit his
              job to pursue his dream" storyline, he produces not-so-typical barbecue. Combining a disciplined attention
              to detail with traditional Central Texas barbecue techniques, he consistently creates outstanding barbecue
              that is not often found 'round these parts.

            At Smoke & Meat BBQ, we strive to bring you the best Central-Texas BBQ we can produce. We think it's pretty
            good. We use simple, traditional live-fire methods... we're just very particular about them. From our
            simple, traditional S&P Brisket, to our meticulously crafted Smoked Links, no corners are cut (well, we do
            trim the sharp corners off the brisket, so I guess there's that?), no fillers or injections needed, no
            automation required, just straight-forward, Central-Texas style BBQ. Just smoke from burning wood & meat.
            And some paprika sometimes.</p>

          <p class="font1">
            We took inspiration from the best of the best Cen-Tex BBQ joints and brought them home to Cali. From
            Franklin's smoked brisket, to L&L's beef cheeks (these little bundles of meaty heaven will change the way
            you think about BBQ. For reals. It's kiiiinda crazy.), we've got what you may not know you need for catering
            your next event, or if you come by for one of our pop-ups. All of our meats are either smoked on our offset
            smoker or a Santa Maria grill (we ARE still in California, after all) using locally sourced Oak, Almond, and
            Cherry. We smoke the good stuff out here too, Tootsie.
